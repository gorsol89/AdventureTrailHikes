            <h4>Our hikes</h4>
            <h5>Short hikes</h5>
            <h6>Our short hikes are perfect for weekend getaways or teambuilding trips. Normally these are day trips from a local base, and do not require camping equipment.</h6>
            <h5>Camping hikes</h5>
            <h6>Camping hikes are longer than short hikes and include 3 or more nights camping. You may bring your own camping equipment, or we can supply it for you.</h6>        
            <h5>Long Hikes</h5>
            <h6>Long Hikes
            These are the most extreme of all of our extreme hikes, and are usually two weeks or longer. They include trekking, local culture and food, as well as nature excursions. These are our physically demanding hikes, so if you are planning to do one of these you should be in reasonably good physical shape!
