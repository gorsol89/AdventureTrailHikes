                    <h2>Sustainable tourism is important to us. 
                        <br>Our world has amazing natural resources, and it is important that future generations can enjoy them as well. 
                        <br>Not only do we want to ensure we don’t damage natural resources and local communities, 
                        <br>but we want to work together to help them flourish.</h2>
                            <h3>Ethical travel</h3>
                                <p>Our trips are planned with both environmental and cultural sustainability in mind, with the goal of leaving the smallest ecological footprint on the hiking area. 
                                    <br>Participants are expected to respect their hiking trail and behave accordingly.</h3>
                            <h3>Local connections</h3>
                                <p>Adventure Trails works closely with local organizations to ensure that much of the profit goes back to the local communities. 
                                    <br>This may be in the form of infrastructure and trail maintenance to supporting local businesses and communities.</h3>
                            <h3>Respect for nature</h3>
                                <p>Many of our hikes include extra activities such as bird watching and short courses on edible local plants. </h3>
                            <h3>Culture</h3>
                                <p>In the interest of cultural exchange and sustainability Adventure Trails also includes cultural activities, which include experiences of various local customs, dress, theatre, dance, and music.</p>
