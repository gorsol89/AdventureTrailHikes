            <h1>Our Hikes</h1>
                <h2>Adventure Trail Hikes offers different hikes:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Short hikes
                            <p>Our short hikes are perfect for weekend getaways or teambuilding trips.
                                <br>Normally these are day trips from a local base, 
                                <br>and do not require camping equipment.</p>
                                <button><a href="/OurHikes.html">Short hikes</a></button>
                        </li>
                        <li>Camping hikes
                            <p>Camping hikes are longer than short hikes and include 3 or more nights camping.
                                <br>You may bring your own camping equipment, or we can supply it for you.</p>
                                <button><a href="/OurHikes.html">Camping hikes</a></button>
                        </li>
                        <li>Long hikes
                            <p>These are the most extreme of all of our extreme hikes, 
                                <br>and are usually two weeks or longer.
                                <br>They include trekking, local culture and food, 
                                <br>as well as nature excursions.
                                <br>These are our physically demanding hikes, 
                                <br>so if you are planning to do one of these you should be in reasonably good physical shape!</p>
